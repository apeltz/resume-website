          I grew up in Manhattan Beach, currently live in Redondo Beach, and have lived in Southern California my whole life. While I've been lucky enough to travel to some wonderful places, the beach will always be my home. I have been fortunate enough to be surrounded by family and friends that I love here, and this appreciation has largely been the anchor to any past flirtations with living elsewhere. However, I recognize the importance of perspective, so I try to maintain a more globally minded approach when encountering new situations or working with others.

          Before programming I was working in investment banking, advising primarily middle-market clients in a variety of industries including aerospace & defense, media & entertainment, and life sciences. I got to work with dozens of different companies and executives across a number of different assignments, with a focus on sell-side transaction advisory and business & asset valuations. In the process I was able to observe and advise on how these businesses operate, define & achieve success, and respond to challenges. In my roughly six years of investment banking, I was able to learn and develop skills that I believe will translate well into other pursuits, and I'm grateful for the experience I gained there. Ultimately, however, I'd like to work in an environment and industry more encouraging of my passion for creating and my obsession with continuous self-improvement. In an ideal world I would constantly be learning something new and using that knowledge to approach and solve problems. In a way, I'd like my whole career to be a machine learning project where I am both the machine and the engineer. I feel like coding and computer science-related fields are uniquely demanding of this kind of constant self-development and personal evolution, and I'm excited to be a part of an environment more fertile to my aspirations for personal and professional growth.

          I've always been fascinated with creating things, and the ability to create enabled by software engineering is nothing short of amazing. For centuries our ability to build was bounded by tangible inputs- raw materials, physical labor, etc.- and rigid environmental limitations- gravity, aerodynamics, etc… but software engineering focuses on creating things that exist on a completely different plane. Because the things we create through software engineering are largely abstractions, our ideas are not bounded by the same traditional rules of the physical world, and thus are not confined to the same, or any similarly limited, scope. The elimination of capital, equipment, materials, and the like from the building process leaves only the those processes which we, as humans, all innately possess: inspiration, conceptualization, problem solving… add a few dollars worth of physical memory and the the ability to build things has been completely democratized by software engineering. I find this truly empowering and want to take full advantage of it. I want to arm myself with the ability to create, and use that ability to build exciting things.

          No matter how old I get, I don't think my passions will ever age past those I had when I was 10. I'm still awed by space and technology, am fascinated by other worlds, robots, and lasers, and am curious to find out how things work. I also enjoy hearing other people get excited up about what they love. Passion is contagious, and I appreciate anyone that is willing to share what gets them fired up.
