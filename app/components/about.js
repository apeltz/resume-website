          I'm a software engineer dedicated to the creation of powerful web platforms. My experience to-date has been mostly in Javascript, with an emphasis on font-end frameworks, Node.js, and supportive technologies.

          I started programming because I wanted to work in an environment fertile to my passion for creating and encouraging of my obsession with continuous self-improvement. In an ideal world I would constantly be learning something new and using that knowledge to approach and solve increasingly difficult problems. In a way, I'd like my whole life to be a machine learning project where I am both the machine and the engineer. I feel like software engineering is uniquely demanding of this kind of constant self-development and personal evolution, and I'm excited to be challenging myself and growing every day.

          I've always been fascinated with creating things, and the ability to create enabled by software engineering is nothing short of amazing. Because the things we create in code are abstractions, our ideas are not bounded by the same traditional rules of the physical world, and thus are nearly unconstrained. The elimination of capital, equipment, materials, and the like from the building process leaves only the those processes which we, as humans, all innately possess: inspiration, conceptualization, problem solvingâ€¦ add a few dollars worth of physical memory and the the ability to build has been completely democratized. I find this truly empowering and want to take full advantage of it. I want to increasingly arm myself with the ability to create, and use that ability to build exciting things.

          No matter how old I get, I don't think my passions will ever age past those I had when I was 10. I'm still awed by space and technology, am fascinated by other worlds, robots, and lasers, and am curious to find out how things work. I also enjoy hearing other people get excited up about what they love. Passion is contagious, and I appreciate anyone that is willing to share what gets them fired up.
